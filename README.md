# Wrangling Transcriptomics

Lesson for quality control and wrangling RNA-Seq data. This repository is modified from the [Data Carpentry](https://www.datacarpentry.org/) [Genomics Workshop](https://www.datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/) lesson on Wrangling Genomic Data.

## Background

Wrangling transcriptomics trains novice learners on a read counting workflow. Participants will learn how to evaluate sequence quality and what to do if it is not good. We will then cover aligning reads to a genome, and counting reads, as well as discussing different file formats. Results will be visualized. Finally, we will cover how to automate the process by building a shell script.
